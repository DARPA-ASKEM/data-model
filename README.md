# ASKEM Data Store API

## Usage

The API can be started by simply calling

```
docker compose up
```
(Please note that any changes in the `src/generated` directory
will forbid the API from starting.)

## Development

Assuming you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (and preferably Docker), 
initialize the project using the following commands:
```
git clone git@github.com:DARPA-ASKEM/data-service.git
cd data-service
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install
```

To start the server in a docker container, run:
```
docker compose --profile dev up
```
which will also start a development instance of Postgres.

The server will not start if the generated model files are dirty i.e.
out of sync data model version or a non-autogenerated change to the
file contents. (Version is tracked using the DBML project `Note`).
The Jataware Python package [dbml-builder](https://pypi.org/project/dbml-builder/)
handles the code generation.

To generate new model files, run:
```
poetry run model-build generate ./askem.dbml ./src/autogen
```

and check if they are valid by running

```
poetry run model-build check CURRENT_SEMANTIC_VERSION ./src/autogen
```

If the tables don't exist yet it in Postgres, make sure to POST to the `/admin/db/init`
endpoint.
